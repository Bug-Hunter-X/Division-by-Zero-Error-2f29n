This repository contains a Solidity code example demonstrating a common error: division by zero. The `bug.sol` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.sol` provides a corrected version with error handling.  This is a crucial example for understanding robust Solidity development and preventing runtime exceptions.
